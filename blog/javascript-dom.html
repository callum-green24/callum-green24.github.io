        Javascript is... well its a lot of gibberish to me still but put simply
        it brings functionality and interaction to your websites. Do you like
        buttons that do something when you click them? I sure do.
      </p>

    <button id="something">Button</button>

      <h2>If HTML, CSS and JS were a guitar</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>HTML:</strong> would be the body and the neck. It is the
        structure that holds everything together.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>CSS:</strong>would be the design of the guitar. Its shape its
        colours. CSS is the style and how things are laid out within the
        structure.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Javascript:</strong>would be the musician plucking the guitar
        stringsm, making them move and create music. Javascript is the
        interaction and functionality of your webpage.

      <h2>The DOM (Document Object Model)</h2>
      <p>
        The DOM is the thing you can pull up when inspecting a webpage. The doms
        like book which you can jump around to any chapter you please and make
        edits. You could use it as a contents page finding specific sections of
        code you can then alter.

      <h2>Control flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Control flow:</strong>is the order of operations your computer
        will follow. Like putting together a piece of furniture or saying the
        alphabet you follow along step by step, A to Z
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Loops</strong>a loop is a task that repeats until all of the
        criteria placed on them have been met. Like a traffic light turning red,
        orange, green although that is a loop without an end.

      <h2>Arrays, Functions and Objects</h2>
      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>
        Arrays are containers for multiple ordered elements which can be
        accessed by the number in which the sit in that array. Imagine those
        advent calenders you used to get at christmas with the chocolates on
        each day. The array is the calander and the elements are the chocolates.
        How you access the element in the array is through the number they are
        positioned (remember the first number is 0)

      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are peices of code designed to perform tasks. Below is a basic
        function adding together two parameters. Functions are very helpful in
        making otherwise repetitive and time consuming tasks quick and easy.
        They can also be used at your leisure.

      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>
        Objects are containers which store a bunch of information related to the
        parent such as data or functions. Below is my phone being represtented
        as and object in code. They way you access data in an object is through
        key value pairs. Either dot notation or square brackets(when the value
        is not a valid identifier)
