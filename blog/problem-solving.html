      <h2>When was I blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
      <p>
        Now to me this wasn’t a simple problem. Still isn’t, if I was asked to
        do it again now without internet I’m not confident I could.<br />
        We were asked to find the first object Scooby was hiding in using a
        function and the .find() method. I began with pseudocode but did not
        find that helpful so I jumped into searching the internet for solutions.
        At this point I had been doing the Kata for awhile and didn’t feel like
        I was taking anything in as well as getting frustrated so I ended up
        taking a break. When I got back it was back to reading and from there a
        bunch of trial and error until I eventually got it right. What I learned
        is sometimes rest is the best path to a solution.

      <h2>When did I elegantly solving a problem?</h2>
      <p>
        I wouldn’t say it was elegant but I was happy with the way I figured out
        how to get an average out of an array because ,without googling anything
        I was very close to getting my ‘for loop’ correct on the first try. What
        I got wrong I was able to figure out very quickly searching for
        solutions online. I learned that I am picking things up even if it feels
        like Im 10 steps behind.

      <h2>Confidence in problem solving techniques</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Needs a lot of work but I see how useful
          it could be once I get the hang of it
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Try something/Googling:</strong>This combination is my go to
          currently although I would like to be less reliant on google
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong>I do this a lot and find it
          helpful. I don’t have a rubber duck.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Console.logging:</strong>I don’t use this nearly enough and am
          not confident with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asking your peers/coaches for help:</strong>Not something I
          did nearly enough but I wouldn’t say its an issue with confidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong>I feel like I’m constantly reflecting in
          my head but I need to improve on being intentional with it and writing
          it in some form or another.

      <h2>Reflections on being reluctant to ask for help</h2>
      <p>
        I could have and should have asked for help on a lot of the Kata, I
        ended up exceeding the time box by a fair bit. It stems from a mix of
        things. Im stubborn and believe I can figure things out given time, I
        don’t want to waste other peoples time and I don’t want people to
        realise how bad at this I am. What can I do differently? The opposite of
        what I was doing this kata.
