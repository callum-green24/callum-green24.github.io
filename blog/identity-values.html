      <h3>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

      <p>
        When I was in my mid late teens I had to get my car repaired and was
        living pay check to pay check so I went to my grandmother for help. We
        are not a wealthy family so the money I was asking for was significant
        ($500) and the deal was I would pay it back at $50 a week over two and a
        half months which was fine with me. Anyway she ended up putting the $500
        through twice which may have gone unnoticed on her part as she isn't
        savvy with that sort of stuff. I considered hanging on to it but
        returned it because I valued the relationship with my Grandmother and
        did not want to break that trust. The values involved were honesty and
        trust I suppose. Looking back, although that money was much needed by me
        at the time, I made the right decision.

      <h3>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Ive never thought of myself as having a culture growing up, coming from
        a small family I always liked thinking I was carving my own path and not
        influenced by those around me. Looking back I know now I was wrong. I
        grew up around fishing and diving which made me appreciate time spent
        outdoors, I also think it instilled in me a patience that I may not have
        gained otherwise. My father taught me how treat people, not by telling
        me how it should be, just by being who he was.

        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your

      <p>
        I did two online tests to have a look what would come from
        <a href="str.html">them </a> and I wasnt too surprised. I think my
        biggest strenght in the context of being a complete bigenner are my
        patience and my ability to solve problems.

      <h3>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Im not too sure how to answer this. I have plenty of limitations but the
        honest answer is I don't know yet. Discipline to self learn during and
        after this course will be my biggest hurdle I feel. Also accepting that
        things will not be perfect and having the ability to not sit on one
        thing for too long trying to get it exactly right (like I did when I
        started making this.)

        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with

        other strategies you would try now and why.

      <p>
        When I was eighteen I was in this army bootcamp. A portion of it was
        spent camping in the bush and on this particular day we were doing a
        cross country orientation challenge where we were split into teams.
        There were no designated leaders but for whatever reason I ended up
        being the one making the calls. There was some bad blood on my team
        between myself and this guy which had carried over from other
        competitions we had been part of together and he was being difficult. As
        we walked to our next objective I lagged behind the group with him and
        instead of being confrontational I framed the conversation about being
        that I needed his help as he was the best at this (which was
        manipulative) it worked and the rest of the course went well. We ended
        up placing second. In hind site I may have approached it differently
        instead of stroking his ego, I'm not sure, it seemed the easiest and
        quickest resolution at the time and when we started working together we
        started flying through, he had some good contributions.
