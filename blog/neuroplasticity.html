        It’s the brains ability to change and build new connections through
        practice and new experiences. Like engaging a muscle group that
        otherwise lays reasonably dormant and them growing over time.<br /><br />Something
        interesting I found while researching this was was Neurogenisis which is
        the creation of new brain cells throughout adult life, which is not
        todays topic but still pretty cool.

      <h2>Benefits of understanding Neuroplasticity</h2>
    </div>

      <p>
        Learning and confidence in learning.<br />
        Understanding the benefits of the principles of Neuroplasticity I’ve
        come to quickly believe is essential especially from a young age. It
        lets you know that you are not at your peak of intelligence or learning
        and it is a journey. It lets people understand that repetition and
        practice can lead to improved skill on whatever they are working on as
        the brain will rewire.<br />
        Another benefit of understanding this ability to rewire or form new
        connections is in the rehabilitation of people with brain injury.

        Learning learning learning. Stay curious and excited about new ideas and
        delve into new subjects on more than a surface level. Practice.<br /><br />

        Mindfulness and Meditation have been shown to be good for
        Neuroplasticity. Reducing stress, enhancing cognition, changes is brain
        connections, enhanced neural communication with the networks involves in
        attention, emotion processing and cognitive control. Regular meditation
        has also been shown to lead to increased grey matter density in some
        regions. Meditation has never been something I have had any success in
        but after learning this I am excited to give it another try.

    <div class="container"><h2>What is it and why is it relevant?</h2></div>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Its the belief that you are not static you have the ability to develop
        throng hard work and its relevant because it nurtures persistence and
        not just the willingness to embrace challenges but the understanding
        that should you fail its just for now as you can continue to grow.

        After learning about this was there anything that surprised or changed
        for me?

      <p>
        Surprised. Sure. I had always thought I had a growth mindset although I
        had never heard the term or read anything about it but its principles I
        thought I carried, but thinking back to when I was at school and
        throughout my life after I have had a very fixed mindset way of
        thinking. Is it possible to carry both sets of characteristics at the
        same time? I feel I do.

        By taking each challenge and failure as a step forward rather than back,
        part of my foundation that I can build on. By remaining focused on

        By incorporating a growth mindset and the understanding of
