        The short answer? Boundaries.<br />
        Both of these are handy because they can be displayed inline or adjacent
        to other elements horizontally. inline; means your element doesnt have
        their own defined space and adjust based on their content, you can not
        set width and height paramaters. It takes up only the space it needs. As
        far as boundaries goes it respects them to its left and right but does
        not pay any mind to elements above or below which can lead to overlap.

      Inline block works the same way, allowing elements to sit side by side.
      The difference is inline-block allows you to manipulate height and width
      and it respects top and bottom boundaries as shown below.
