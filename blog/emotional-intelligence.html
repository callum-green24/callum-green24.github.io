    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <h6>
      For sprint 3 we’ve been asked to research EQ, something I was aware of but
      never really delved into.
    </h6>
    <h2>What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        IQ is a measure of cognitive ability measured through standardised
        testing done generally done by professionals whereas EQ is emotional and
        social intelligence which is self measured.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>So what is Emotional Intelligence and why is it important?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to be introspective and and
        aware of your emotions for starters. Hard for some, easier for others,
        which I think has a lot to do with how you were raised. Just being aware
        of them is just the beginning you then have to try understand them, what
        they are, what triggers them, how it affects your decision making or
        behaviours, what thoughts come along with them? (It honestly sounds
        exhausting, I much prefer to just get on with things but you can’t grow
        without a bit of change right?) With this deeper understanding of your
        emotions comes a better ability to manage or regulate them which makes
        all the sense in the world to me because how can you expect to control
        something without first understanding what it is or why its there.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Emotional regulation is something needed to be functional within
        society, if we all acted on every impulse or emotion there wouldn’t be
        many people wandering around free, maybe if you’re a monk. Practicing
        regulation of self is important for times of stress or challenging
        situations, it can help with your ability to adapt and move through life
        without overreacting. Another of the core components of EI is motivation
        and the ability to be self motivated which I find very appealing but
        find myself lacking at times.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        The other half of EI is being able to empathise with others and deal
        with people socially, to understand another persons perspective and be
        conscious of how they feel is key when working in a team environment.
        Being able to communicate assertively, compromise where necessary,
        resolve conflict and maintain relationships require a good amount of EI.
