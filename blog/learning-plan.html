      <p>
        Im still unsure, I was thinking maybe cybersecurity when I first began
        but I think I am going to enjoy building things. If I could find a
        career I could incorperate into travel that would be ideal

        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think remembering things will be an issue for me. Reaching out for
        help when I need it.

      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not sure in terms of career progression. I don’t know enough yet. My
        goal is to get proficient with these languages.

      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm a patient person which I feel will be my biggest strength at the
        beginning of this as there will be quite a steep learning curve on my
        end.<br />Leaving school at an early age means I don’t have much
        experience in sitting down and studying a subject for long periods, and
        being disciplined with self learning could be a struggle.

        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Reaching out to others for help and time management are the ones that
        come to mind.
      </p>

        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.

      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will always try to figure things out for myself first, my issue will
        be spending too much time trying to go at it alone. I will set myself a
        time limit and if I cant grasp it I will reach out to a facilitator.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        To be knowledgable on the subject being taught and to be able to explain
        it clearly if needed. To be available for help. To understand that not
        all students have the same level of experience.

        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
