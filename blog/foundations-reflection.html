        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ive learnt that I am able to pick absorb new information on a completely
        new subject and understand the subject matter put forward.<br />
        I can fail without throwing in the towel and persevere.<br />
        Im able to ask for help.

        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Things like accountability, effective problem solving, continued
        learning and emotional intelligence.

        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Things like having ability to work in a team and learning how to learn
        are just as if not more valuable than being an expert coder
      </p>

      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        No. Having the break from code is a good reset and having that constant
        reflection reinforced is beneficial. I also learned some things about
        myself.
